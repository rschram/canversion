## Acknowledgements & development notes

### AI collaboration statement

This project, from its initial conception to its final implementation, was developed in close collaboration with Google's Gemini, a large language model. The development process was conversational, iterative, and co-creative.

The AI's role in this project included, but was not limited to:

* Initial Code Generation: Generating the foundational Python scripts for each module based on high-level descriptions of the desired functionality.

* Debugging and Refactoring: Identifying bugs, suggesting fixes, and refactoring complex functions for better readability and robustness. This included diagnosing API error messages, fixing data processing logic, and improving template rendering.

* Feature Extension: Providing step-by-step guidance and code for adding new features, such as the tasks for generating the static wiki site.

* Documentation: Generating the initial user and developer documentation, which was then refined.

* Creative Brainstorming: Acting as a creative partner in developing the project's identity, including brainstorming the name "Canversion" and generating taglines.

It is important to note that the human developer (Ryan Schram) guided every step of this process, making key architectural decisions, testing the code, and providing the domain-specific knowledge required to build a useful tool for academic workflows.

### Project status & caveats

* Testing: While the core functionality for generating Canvas and wiki pages has been tested, not all features and edge cases have been fully validated. This software is provided "as is," and users should test it thoroughly with their own data on a non-production (test) course site before deploying it for a live class.

* Tone and Satire: During the creative brainstorming phase for the project's name and marketing copy, the AI was explicitly instructed to adopt a sarcastic, cynical, and biting tone as a satirical take on "ed-tech" marketing. The resulting taglines and ad copy are a product of that specific creative prompt.

As an example of this collaborative and creative process, here is one of the 10-second radio spot scripts generated during our sessions:

    (SOUND of a coffee mug being set down firmly on a desk)

    Educational Designer: Great news! We've updated the content editor. Now, all your numbered lists will automatically convert into a "journey" infographic.

    Teacher (flatly): My syllabus has 47 items. What kind of journey is that?

    Announcer: Want to write in plain text for Canvas? Do a Canversion.

### More AI taglines I rejected

* WYSI-WYG is what you get. Canversion is what you meant.
* Submit to the LMS. Not its editor.
* Stop clicking. Start teaching.
* Your course, your text, your rules.

It also really liked one that said "the ritual must be completed." Yeah...

### Meta-acknowledgement

In case it's not obvious, the AI also wrote this note and the interactive documentation.
